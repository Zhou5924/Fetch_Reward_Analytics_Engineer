        <h1>Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Analytics Engineer</h1>


        <h2>In this exercise you will:</h2>

            <p>
                Demonstrate how you reason about data and how you communicate your understanding of a 
                specific data set to others. 
            </p>


        <h2>What are the requirements?</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Review unstructured JSON data and diagram a new structured relational data model</li>
                <li>Generate a query that answers a predetermined business question </li>
                <li>Generate a query to capture data quality issues against the new structured relational data model</li>
                <li>Write a short email or Slack message to the business stakeholder</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Please let us know which SQL dialect you are using and include any code, notes, etc.. that helped you develop your answers. Showing your work can only help you!</p>


        <h3>First: Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model</h3>

            <p>
                Review the 3 sample data files provided below. Develop a simplified, structured, relational 
                diagram to represent how you would model the data in a data warehouse. The diagram should 
                show each table’s fields and the joinable keys. You can use pencil and paper, readme, or any 
                digital drawing or diagramming tool with which you are familiar. If you can upload the text, 
                image, or diagram into a git repository and we can read it, we will review it!
            </p>


        <h3>Second: Write a query that directly answers a predetermined question from a business stakeholder</h3>

            <p>
                Write a SQL query against your new structured relational data model that answers one of the following 
                bullet points below of your choosing. Commit it to the git repository along with the rest of the exercise.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: When creating your data model be mindful of the other requests being made by 
                the business stakeholder. If you can capture more than one bullet point in your model 
                while keeping it clean, efficient, and performant, that benefits you as well as your team.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?</li>
                <li>How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month?</li>
                <li>When considering <i>average spend</i> from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?</li>
                <li>When considering <i>total number of items purchased</i> from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?</li>
                <li>Which brand has the most <i>spend</i> among users who were created within the past 6 months?</li> 
                <li>Which brand has the most <i>transactions</i> among users who were created within the past 6 months?</li>
            </ul>


        <h3>Third: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided</h3>

            <p>
                Using the programming language of your choice (SQL, Python, R, Bash, etc...) identify at least one data quality issue.
                We are not expecting a full blown review of all the data provided, but instead want to know how you explore and evaluate
                data of questionable provenance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Commit your code and findings to the git repository along with the rest of the exercise.
            </p>
            

        <h3>Fourth: Communicate with Stakeholders</h3>

            <p>
                Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who isn’t 
                familiar with your day to day work. This part of the exercise should show off how you communicate and 
                reason about data with others. Commit your answers to the git repository along with the rest of your exercise.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>What questions do you have about the data?</li>
                <li>How did you discover the data quality issues?</li>
                <li>What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?</li>
                <li>What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?</li>
                <li>What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>How do I submit my exercise?</h2>

            <p>Provide a link to a public repository (i.e., GitHub, Bitbucket) to your recruiter. Please do not send files directly via email.</p>


        <h2>FAQs</h2>
            

        <h3>How will this exercise be evaluated?</h3>

            <p>
                An engineer will review the code and documentation you submit. At a minimum ER diagrams should be legible and SQL must be runnable. 
                While your solution does not need to be fully production ready, you are being evaluated so put your best foot forward!
            </p>
        

        <h3>I have questions about the problem statement.</h3>

            <p>
                For any requirements not specified above, use your best judgement to determine expected result. 
                You can elaborate on your decisions via the documentation you provide in your repo.
            </p>
        
        
        <h3>Can I provide a private repository?</h3>
        
            <p>
                If at all possible, we prefer a public repository because we do not know which engineer will be 
                evaluating your submission. Providing a public repository ensures a speedy review of your submission. 
                If you are still uncomfortable providing a public repository, you can work with your recruiter to provide access to the reviewing engineer.
            </p>


        <h3>How long do I have to complete the exercise?</h3>

            <p>
                There is no time limit for the exercise. Out of respect for your time, we designed this exercise with 
                the intent that it should take you a few hours. But, please take as much time as you need to complete the work.
            </p>
